Estimated Annual Income ("EAI") and Estimated Yield ("EY") calculations are for informational purposes only. The actual income and yield might be lower or higher than the estimated amounts. EY is based upon EAI and
the current price of the security and will fluctuate. For certain types of securities, the calculations could include a return of principal or capital gains in which case EAI and EY would be overstated. EY and EAI are not
promptly updated to reflect when an issuer has missed a regular payment or announced changes to future payments, in which case EAI and EY will continue to display at a prior rate.

Terms and Conditions

GENERAL INFORMATION AND KEY TERMS: This Account statement is furnished solely by Charles
Schwab & Co., Inc. ("Schwab") for your Account at Schwab ("Account"). Unless otherwise defined herein,
capitalized terms have the same meanings as in your Account Agreement. If you receive any other
communication from any source other than Schwab which purports to represent your holdings at Schwab
(including balances held at a Depository Institution) you should verify its content with this statement.
Accrued Income: Accrued Income is the sum of the total accrued interest and/or accrued dividends on
positions held in your Account, but the interest and/or dividends have not been received into your Account.
Schwab makes no representation that the amounts shown (or any other amount) will be received. Accrued
amounts are not covered by SIPC account protection until actually received and held in the Account. AIP
(Automatic Investment Plan) Customers: Schwab receives remuneration in connection with certain
transactions effected through Schwab. If you participate in a systematic investment program through
Schwab, the additional information normally detailed on a trade confirmation will be provided upon request.
Average Daily Balance: Average daily composite of all cash balances that earn interest and all loans from
Schwab that are charged interest. Bank Sweep and Bank Sweep for Benefit Plans Features: Schwab
acts as your agent and custodian in establishing and maintaining your Deposit Account(s) as a feature of
your brokerage Account(s). Deposit accounts held through these bank sweep features constitute direct
obligations of one or more FDIC insured banks ("Program Banks") that are not obligations of Schwab.
Funds swept to Program Banks are eligible for deposit insurance from the FDIC up to the applicable limits
for each bank for funds held in the same insurable capacity. The balance in the Deposit Accounts can be
withdrawn on your order and the proceeds returned to your brokerage Account or remitted to you as provided
in your Account Agreement. For information on FDIC insurance and its limits, as well as other important
disclosures about the bank sweep feature(s) in your Account(s), please refer to the Cash Features
Disclosure Statement available online or from a Schwab representative. Cash: Any Free Credit Balance
owed by us to you payable upon demand which, although accounted for on our books of record, is not
segregated and may be used in the conduct of this firm's business. Dividend Reinvestment Customers:
Dividend reinvestment transactions were effected by Schwab acting as a principal for its own account,
except for the reinvestment of Schwab dividends, for which an independent broker-dealer acted as the
buying agent. Further information on these transactions will be furnished upon written request. Gain (or

Loss): Unrealized Gain or (Loss) and Realized Gain or (Loss) sections ("Gain/Loss Section(s)") contain a
gain or a loss summary of your Account. This information has been provided on this statement at the
request of your Advisor, if applicable. This information is not a solicitation or a recommendation to buy or
sell. Schwab does not provide tax advice and encourages you to consult with your tax
professional. Please view the Cost Basis Disclosure Statement for additional information on how
gain (or loss) is calculated and how Schwab reports adjusted cost basis information to the IRS.
Interest: For the Schwab One Interest, Bank Sweep, and Bank Sweep for Benefit Plans features, interest is
paid for a period that may differ from the Statement Period. Balances include interest paid as indicated on
your statement by Schwab or one or more of its Program Banks. These balances do not include interest that
may have accrued during the Statement Period after interest is paid. The interest paid may include interest
that accrued in the prior Statement Period. For the Schwab One Interest feature, interest accrues daily from
the second-to-last business day of the prior month and is posted on the second-to-last business day of the
current month. For the Bank Sweep and Bank Sweep for Benefit Plans features, interest accrues daily from
the 16th day of the prior month and is credited/posted on the first business day after the 15th of the current
month. If, on any given day, the interest that Schwab calculates for the Free Credit Balances in the Schwab
One Interest feature in your brokerage Account is less than $.005, you will not accrue any interest on that
day. For balances held at banks affiliated with Schwab in the Bank Sweep and Bank Sweep for Benefit
Plans features, interest will accrue even if the amount is less than $.005. Margin Account Customers:
This is a combined statement of your margin account and special memorandum account maintained for you
under Section 220.5 of Regulation T issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The
permanent record of the separate account as required by Regulation T is available for your inspection.
Securities purchased on margin are Schwab's collateral for the loan to you. It is important that you fully
understand the risks involved in trading securities on margin. These risks include: 1) You can lose more
funds than you deposit in the margin account; 2) Schwab can force the sale of securities or other assets in
any of your account(s) to maintain the required account equity without contacting you; 3) You are not entitled
to choose which assets are liquidated nor are you entitled to an extension of time on a margin call; 4)
Schwab can increase its "house" maintenance margin requirements at any time without advance written
notice to you. Market Price: The most recent price evaluation available to Schwab on the last business day

of the report period, normally the last trade price or bid as of market close. Unpriced securities denote that
no market evaluation update is currently available. Price evaluations are obtained from outside parties.
Schwab shall have no responsibility for the accuracy or timeliness of any such valuations. Assets Not Held
at Schwab are not held in your Account or covered by the Account's SIPC account protection and are not
otherwise in Schwab's custody and are being provided as a courtesy to you. Information on Assets Not Held
at Schwab, including but not limited to valuations, is reported solely based on information you provide to
Schwab. Schwab can neither validate nor certify the existence of Assets Not Held at Schwab or the
accuracy, completeness or timeliness of the information about Assets Not Held at Schwab, whether
provided by you or otherwise. Descriptions of Assets Not Held at Schwab may be abbreviated or truncated.
Some securities, especially thinly traded equities in the OTC market or foreign markets, may not report the
most current price and are indicated as Stale Priced. Certain Limited Partnerships (direct participation
programs) and unlisted Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) securities, for which you may see a value on
your monthly Account statement that reflects the issuer's appraised estimated value, are not listed on a
national securities exchange, and are generally illiquid. Even if you are able to sell such securities, the price
received may be less than the per share appraised estimated value provided in the account statement.
Market Value: The Market Value is computed by multiplying the Market Price by the Quantity of Shares.
This is the dollar value of your present holdings in your specified Schwab Account or a summary of the
Market Value summed over multiple accounts. Non-Publicly Traded Securities: All assets shown on this
statement, other than certain direct investments which may be held by a third party, are held in your Account.
Values of certain Non-Publicly Traded Securities may be furnished by a third party as provided by Schwab's
Account Agreement. Schwab shall have no responsibility for the accuracy or timeliness of such valuations.
The Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) does not cover many limited partnership interests.
Schwab Sweep Money Funds: Includes the primary money market funds into which Free Credit Balances
may be automatically invested pursuant to your Account Agreement. Schwab or an affiliate acts and receives
compensation as the Investment Advisor, Shareholder Service Agent and Distributor for the Schwab Sweep
Money Funds. The amount of such compensation is disclosed in the prospectus. The yield information for
Schwab Sweep Money Funds is the current 7-day yield as of the statement period. Yields vary. If on any
given day, the accrued daily dividend for your selected sweep money fund as calculated for your account is
less than % of 1 cent ($0.005), your account will not earn a dividend for that day. In addition, if you do not
accrue at least 1 daily dividend of $0.01 during a pay period, you will not receive a money market dividend for
that period. Schwab and the Schwab Sweep Money Funds investment advisor may be voluntarily reducing a
portion of a Schwab Sweep Money Fund's expenses. Without these reductions, yields would have been

lower. Securities Products and Services: Securities products and services are offered by Charles
Schwab & Co., Inc., Member SIPC. Securities products and services, including unswept intraday
funds and net credit balances held in brokerage accounts are not deposits or other obligations of,
or guaranteed by, any bank, are not FDIC insured, and are subject to investment risk and may lose
value. SIPC does not cover balances held at Program Banks in the Bank Sweep and Bank Sweep
for Benefit Plans features. Please see your Cash Feature Disclosure Statement for more information on
insurance coverage. Yield to Maturity: This is the actual average annual return on a note if held to maturity.

brokerage activity (other than an electronic fund transfer) you must notify us promptly, but no
later than 10 days after this statement is sent or made available to you. If this statement shows that

transactions. IN CASE OF COMPLAINTS: If you have a complaint regarding your Schwab statement,
