Proceeds from Broker and Barter Exchange Transactions
2023 1099-B* OMB No. 1545-0715 02/10/2024
Sales transactions are organized into sections according to term (long, short or undetermined) and covered status (covered or noncovered). For tax lots whose term is undetermined, use your historical
documents to establish the cost basis and date of purchase. The Box 12, Check if basis reported to IRS checkmark, is reflected as being checked in the title of the covered securities pages of Forms
1099-B, short-term and long-term. The title pages of the noncovered securities pages for Forms 1099-B reflect that Box 12 is not being checked, as these securities are not being reported to the IRS.
Several columns include both an amount and a qualifying notation to its right. Where proceeds are the result of an option exercise or assignment, there is indication of whether the amount is N (net of
option premium) or G (Gross). Accrued market discount and wash sale loss disallowed appear in the same column, identified by the letters D or W, respectively. Where you are not permitted to
recognize a loss, an indication of X (change in control or capital structure) or Z (other corporate action) is used. The change in control condition is reported to the IRS for covered lots. Neither the
disallowance of loss due to a corporate action nor the amount of gain or loss is reported to the IRS in any instance.
Some tax lots may have notations in the column of Additional Information because they require special treatment on your tax returns. Sales of securities such as Contingent Payment Debt Instruments
(CPDI) are marked as “Ordinary” because gains and losses on these instruments generally do not qualify as short- or long-term capital transactions. Similarly, lots noted as “3 - [X] Collectible” are
handled distinctly under the tax code. These conditions are reported to the IRS. You may wish to consult with your tax advisor, the IRS or your state tax authority regarding the proper treatment for
these scenarios. With further regard to Box 3, there is also a checkmark to indicate the proceeds of sale are from a Qualified Opportunity Zone Fund investment - a QOF. If the proceeds are from a QOF
the Additional Information column will reflect the following - “3 - [X] Proceeds from QOF.” The tax treatment for QOF investments can be complex and you may wish to consult your tax advisor about
such sales.
Closing of written options is presented in a distinct manner in accordance with IRS regulations. For these transactions the Cost or other basis (column 1e) is always presented as $0.00 and the
Proceeds (column 1d) is the net of the amount received when the option was written and the cost to close the position.

Detail for Dividends and Distributions
2023 02/10/2024
This section of your tax information statement contains the payment level detail of your taxable dividends, capital gains distributions, Section 199A dividends, Section 897 dividends and capital gains,
exempt-interest dividends, nondividend distributions and liquidation distributions. Also shown are the fair market values of any taxable stock dividends or noncash liquidation distributions.
Federal, state and foreign tax withheld and investment expenses are presented as negative amounts but do not net against the reportable income totals. All amounts are grouped by security, with the
transactions listed in chronological order. Subtotals for each security are provided. For situations in which the tax character of a distribution (or part thereof) is different than at the time it was paid,
endnotes are provided for further explanation.
Note that a payment characterized as a “Qualified dividend” is only issuer-qualified. There is also a holder level criteria for a dividend to be treated as Qualified. If the payment is from a common stock
you are required to have held it for more than 60 days during the 121-day period that begins 60 days before the ex-dividend date of the dividend. If the dividend is from preferred shares and covers a
period greater than 366 days, you must have held the preferred stock for more than 90 days during the 181-day period that begins 90 days before the ex-dividend date of the dividend.
Amounts presented in Box 2e as Section 897 Ordinary Dividends or Box 2f as Section 897 Capital Gains apply only to foreign persons and entities whose income maintains its character when passed
through or distributed to its direct or indirect foreign owners or beneficiaries, The IRS has indicated that boxes 2e and 2f are not applicable to recipients that are U.S. individuals. You should consult your
tax advisor for further information.
